                            How much refund will you get?
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            You are entitled to avail only 50% amount of your total cost once you apply for the refund before 7 days prior to the scheduled exam date. However, any request made less than this time limit will be crashed and won’t get entertained.
                            If you haven’t purchased a PTE coupon from us then you are entitled to only 50% of refund. You need to provide your contact details like name, e-mail address and contact number to reach you out. You understand that the information should be right and genuine.
                            You need to pay an extra 25% of the original cost of the coupon in case you want to reschedule your exam.

                            Note- We don’t pay you back in cash. Your refunded amount would be credited into your bank account with 7-10 working days. So, cross-check all the bank details beforehand. We are not responsible for any damage or loss caused by false information.
